1
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,223 
<i>Inherited will,</i>

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,934 
<i>the tide of the times, people's dreams.</i>

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,353 
<i>These things cannot be stopped.</i>

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,898 
<i>As long as people seek</i>
<i>the answer of freedom,</i>

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,776 
<i>these things will never cease to be!</i>

6
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,905 
Hey, Apis! Who are you talking to?

7
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,116 
No! Don't come here!

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,081 
Didn't Lost Island sink
a long long time ago?

9
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:08,169 
Grandpa Ryu says that
the island will surface again,

10
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:14,717 
but he doesn't seem to remember
clearly where it is and there's no clue.

11
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,472 
He was separated from
his friends and lost his energy.

12
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,767 
I want to take him back to his home
no matter what it takes.

13
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,855 
He always tells me that he'll
get his energy back for sure

14
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,649 
once he goes back to the dragons' nest.

15
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,318 
So I'll definitely find it for him.

16
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,029 
Okay, then! I'll take him

17
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,198 
to Lost Island!

18
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:42,495 
Luffy! Were you listening?
Lost Island sank into the sea!

19
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,165 
But since the legendary
Millennial Dragon actually exists,

20
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,501 
I'm sure Lost Island
also exists somewhere!

21
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,669 
An island that's not even on a map?

22
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,130 
Yeah, that's why we're going!

23
00:02:55,925 --> 00:03:00,263 
<i>"Eric Attacks! Great Escape</i>
<i>from Warship Island!"</i>

24
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,561 
It's hot!

25
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,898 
What the heck is that?

26
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,358 
The marines again?

27
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,154 
Hey, everyone! This is so cool!

28
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,615 
What's going on here?

29
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:26,331 
And the 1,201st King was…

30
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,168 
Geez. The story isn't over yet?

31
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,837 
Hey, listen to me.

32
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,384 
What? Is it morning already?

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,391 
I dozed off since the old man's story
was so long.

34
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,106 
There's a problem!
Bokuden-san! Where's Apis?

35
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,733 
What's the matter?

36
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,277 
Ah, you guys are pirates, right?

37
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,821 
A marine fleet started blocking
the harbor!

38
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,283 
It can't be. Just to capture Apis?

39
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,119 
Why are they after a girl like that?

40
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,830 
Hey! Everyone, come with me!

41
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,374 
Certainly, Nami-san!

42
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,375 
Why?

43
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,459 
Just do it!

44
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,253 
What do we do with the old man?

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,882 
Looks like he's sound asleep,
so let's let him be.

46
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,760 
Hey, when Bokuden-san wakes up,

47
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,471 
please tell him that we'll protect Apis.

48
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,306 
Okay.

49
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,815 
Their ship is on the starboard bow!

50
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,278 
Okay! The landing unit will come
to Warship Island with me!

51
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,656 
The rest of the crew
is to seize their ship!

52
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,171 
Hi, everyone!

53
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,259 
This is the Millennial Dragon
Grandpa Bokuden was talking about.

54
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,137 
See? Isn't he cool?

55
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,139 
Don't talk like he's yours!

56
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,683 
When you get closer to the Grand Line,

57
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,185 
you run into things like this, huh?

58
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,606 
Since there're Sea Kings as well,
I guess this is possible.

59
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,862 
Is he really harmless?

60
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,872 
Ah! He can be senile sometimes,
so if he acts like you're food, get away!

61
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,249 
It's too late!

62
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335 
But it doesn't hurt, right?

63
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,797 
I guess you call it soft-mouth?

64
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,176 
What are you saying? He's not a puppy.

65
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,927 
Let him eat you like that!

66
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,805 
Zoro!

67
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,724 
Don't! He'll have food poisoning.

68
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,476 
What did you say, you damn love cook?

69
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,319 
What the marines are after
is this Millennial Dragon.

70
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,322 
Frankly, the reason I brought you here

71
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,367 
is that we'd like to bring this
Millennial Dragon back to Lost Island.

72
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,455 
What are you saying?
The marines are closing in on us!

73
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,831 
We're going to have enough
trouble just getting away.

74
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,374 
How in the heck could we
take such a big creature--

75
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,378 
Grandpa Ryu wants to go home.

76
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,255 
So…

77
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,924 
Don't tell me, Luffy,

78
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,010 
that you promised her, like,
"Yeah! I'll bring him home."

79
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,970 
Yeah, I promised and said,
"I'll bring him home."

80
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,558 
Don't do that! We don't know
where that island is, right?

81
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,561 
How are we supposed to get there?

82
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,480 
If we go, it'll work out somehow.

83
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,148 
As if!

84
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:45,029 
I thought Grandpa Ryu would get
his energy back once he goes home.

85
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,324 
Animals have a migration instinct.

86
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,120 
This Millennial Dragon may know something.

87
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,997 
Yeah. Let's find Lost Island!

88
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,458 
But--

89
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,377 
Well, things will probably
work out, don't you think?

90
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,546 
Zoro.

91
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,215 
That's fine, but what
are we going to do with him?

92
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,676 
Just bringing him down the mountain
alone will be a lot of work.

93
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,013 
First, build a cart!

94
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,392 
A big enough one for Grandpa Ryu to ride.

95
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,647 
All right!

96
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,860 
Gum-Gum Gatling!

97
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,144 
Is this enough?

98
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,438 
Yeah. A-okay!

99
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,107 
Since you did all this,
I guess I have no choice.

100
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,359 
I'll do it. All right, I'll do it!

101
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,659 
I guess this is it.

102
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,455 
This thing won't break
even when Grandpa Ryu rides it!

103
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,873 
Yeah!

104
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,628 
But the harbor is blocked
by the marines, right?

105
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,587 
What will we do with the ship?

106
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,798 
Isn't it going to work out?

107
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,883 
No, it won't.

108
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,051 
Shall we make a raid?

109
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,261 
Yeah, good idea.

110
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,556 
That's not going to work
since we have Grandpa Ryu.

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,809 
I have an idea about how
we can carry him out of here.

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,812 
By the way, I want the Going Merry

113
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773 
to be brought to the rear of the island.

114
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,735 
Okay! It's the precious ship
that Kaya gave us. I'll do it.

115
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,153 
He's so cool!

116
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,739 
However, Zoro comes with me!

117
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,157 
Me too?

118
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,825 
Then I'll leave it to you guys.

119
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,118 
Okay! So,

120
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,578 
how about we wait until nightfall?

121
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,788 
No!

122
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:06,420 
Bring the ship to the edge of the cape
that looks like Usopp's nose.

123
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,424 
You're right! That's Usopp's nose.

124
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,427 
So what are we going to do?
Just bringing the ship won't--

125
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,387 
Don't worry about it.

126
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,349 
I don't think they'd find
this place so easily,

127
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,892 
but in any case, hurry up.

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,937 
What? Doing things
on a hit-or-miss basis like that isn't--

129
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,107 
Sanji-kun! Luffy!
Put Grandpa Ryu on the cart.

130
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,192 
-Okay!
-Okay, Nami-san!

131
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,077 
Hey, old man!
Where are you hiding this girl?

132
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,958 
Hey! Wake up!

133
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:49,589 
Oh. Did I already talk about
the 1,201st King?

134
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,591 
What are you talking about?

135
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,467 
Lt. Commander!

136
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,679 
There are tracks from something
being dragged in the backyard!

137
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,184 
Eric! Did you find anything?

138
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,440 
These tracks must've been made by them.

139
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,444 
They should be hiding
somewhere in the mountain.

140
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,155 
Okay! We'll track them down!

141
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,494 
This is why I suggested
that we wait until night.

142
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,874 
What are you doing?

143
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,393 
I'll go on ahead.

144
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,823 
Meh mound me!

145
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,284 
-It's them!
-Don't let him escape! Fire!

146
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,958 
Zoro!

147
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,170 
What?

148
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,798 
There was another one?

149
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,508 
Stop! Stop!

150
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,969 
Stop! Or we'll fire!

151
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,887 
Stop!

152
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:32,191 
What? Are they going to ram us?

153
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,486 
Maht? Mis is mad!

154
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,866 
It's going to ram us!

155
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,201 
Furl the sails!

156
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,871 
It's too late now!

157
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,865 
Prepare to set sail!

158
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,658 
Yes, sir!

159
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,120 
Hoist the anchor!

160
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,748 
Furl the sails!

161
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,504 
Go after that pirate ship!

162
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,881 
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

163
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,843 
Here they come!

164
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,642 
We've got trouble!

165
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,977 
The bird said that
the marines are getting close!

166
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,028 
Oh. They came sooner than I thought.

167
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,405 
Hey, what are you going to do now?

168
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,907 
You don't have to worry

169
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,076 
because we have these two.

170
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,042 
Once the Going Merry
is at Usopp's Nose Cape,

171
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,168 
we'll go all the way down.

172
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,136 
That brat is up there.

173
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,015 
What's that?

174
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,892 
It's a monster!

175
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,693 
<i>I finally found Dragonite,</i>
<i>the elixir of immortality!</i>

176
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,279 
Don't panic!

177
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,073 
That's the Millennial Dragon
we've been looking for!

178
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,119 
We'll get closer to them without being
noticed and capture it in one shot!

179
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,078 
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

180
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:42,006 
Dammit! After we went through
all that trouble to escape!

181
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,550 
We haven't yet.

182
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,806 
Don't let them get away!
Capture them without fail!

183
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,394 
Zoro! Zoro! Zoro! Zoro!
Take care of the sail!

184
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,187 
Got it! Leave it to me!

185
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,235 
Dammit! Their ship is big but it's fast!

186
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,247 
No! Don't shoot Grandpa Ryu!

187
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,624 
Apis!

188
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,084 
Grandpa Ryu!

189
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,595 
As I thought, that brat had something
to do with the Millennial Dragon,

190
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:35,392 
although I didn't think that I'd be able
to encounter a real live dragon.

191
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,853 
I no longer care about that brat.

192
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:44,276 
That dragon is the elixir of immortality
that we've been looking for!

193
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,403 
Fire!

194
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,449 
Stop it!

195
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,040 
No use!

196
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,878 
What the heck?

197
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,339 
The bullets definitely…

198
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,300 
So you have powers of a devil fruit.

199
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,678 
That's right. I'm a rubber person.

200
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,638 
Rubber person!

201
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,722 
Devil fruit?

202
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,641 
What's that?

203
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,977 
-Use--
-Use swords!

204
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,603 
Guns don't work against rubber!

205
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,023 
Sanji-kun!

206
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,441 
Yes, Nami-san!

207
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,240 
Gum-Gum Gatling!

208
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,500 
You call yourselves the marines?

209
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,461 
Really, you guys are good for nothing.

210
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,304 
-What was that?
-A knife?

211
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,661 
My name is Eric the Whirlwind.

212
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,081 
I'm a mercenary hired by Nelson Royal.

213
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,084 
We don't have any business
with you pirates.

214
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,421 
We have some business
with that Millennial Dragon.

215
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,797 
If you stand in my way,

216
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,092 
I'll make you a victim of my wind slash,
the power of the Sickle-Sickle Fruit.

217
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,218 
-Hey, he said Sicko Sicko.
-Surprised?

218
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,595 
-Sicko?
-I have the power…

219
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,056 
-What should we do?
-…of a devil fruit, too.

220
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,140 
Nami!

221
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,100 
Do we have to keep going?

222
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,019 
A little bit longer!

223
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,481 
Nami-san's lovely even when
she looks at the distant ocean.

224
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,733 
Just hurry up.

225
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,820 
Hey! You bastards!
Are you listening to me?

226
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,948 
You're Eric the Sicko, right?
We're listening.

227
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,658 
That's not right!

228
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,537 
I didn't say sicko, I said sickle,
like the one that slices!

229
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,457 
We're sicko talking about this!
Just kidding!

230
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,879 
Hope you don't regret making me angry.

231
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,548 
Sickle-Sickle…

232
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,302 
Whirlwind!

233
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,808 
What was that?

234
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,644 
I see. A wind slash, huh?

235
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,816 
The winds I create are as sharp
as legendary swords.

236
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,443 
No matter how trained you are,

237
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,780 
it's easy for me to tear you apart.

238
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,741 
Aren't we going yet?

239
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,742 
No. Not yet!

240
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,705 
Now, out of my way!
Hand over the Millennial Dragon!

241
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,040 
No way!

242
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,378 
Do you wanna experience
the Sickle-Sickle Whirlwind again?

243
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,755 
Aren't we going yet, Nami-san?

244
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,715 
Here they come! They're here!

245
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,927 
Now! Sanji-kun! Luffy!

246
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,679 
Okay, Nami-swan!

247
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,640 
-What?
-We'll be right there!

248
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,311 
Nami-san! I'll be your love catapult!

249
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,486 
I won't let you escape!

250
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,654 
Gum-Gum…

251
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,531 
Sickle-Sickle…

252
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,200 
Pistol!

253
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,286 
Whirlwind!

254
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,041 
I won't let you escape.

255
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,259 
We're going to run into a rock!

256
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,177 
Luffy!

257
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,847 
Gum-Gum Gatling!

258
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,153 
What is this?

259
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,322 
That's how I do it.

260
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,868 
Dumbass!

261
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,625 
That was close.

262
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,382 
Yahoo!

263
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,012 
Yahoo!

264
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,604 
Yahoo!

265
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,113 
Nami said to come to
the edge of that cape, right?

266
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,365 
Yeah.

267
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,787 
Darn. We couldn't get rid of them.

268
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,830 
Yeah.

269
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,585 
Well, after all, we have no choice
but to make a raid. Yikes!

270
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,006 
Go! Go!

271
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,883 
Go!

272
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,052 
Yahoo!

273
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,244 
What a crazy plan that was!

274
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,790 
Well, it worked out!

275
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,376 
Exactly.

276
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,588 
Go after them! Go after that ship!

277
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,926 
We can't move because
the sail is in our way!

278
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,678 
What?

279
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,682 
I think this will do.

280
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,641 
That was fun.

281
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,060 
That was fun!

282
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,521 
Apis! Are you okay?

283
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,023 
Yep!

284
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,776 
Luffy, we can leave any time now.

285
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,111 
Okay!

286
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:06,325 
Set sail for Lost Island!

287
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,326 
But which way?

288
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,245 
That way? Or maybe this way?

289
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,872 
Huh? Huh? Huh?

290
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,833 
Are we going to be okay
when you're so unreliable?

291
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,377 
Well, we'll just have to go.

292
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,005 
It's not on the sea chart, either, so…

293
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,550 
You're lovely, Nami-san,
even when you're decisive.

294
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,552 
You know…

295
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:51,161 
Our destination is Lost Island!

296
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,951 
-<i>Which direction is Lost Island?</i>
-<i>Who knows.</i>

297
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,120 
<i>Grandpa Ryu is sleeping, so…</i>

298
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,663 
<i>You're so irresponsible…</i>

299
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,498 
<i>I don't see it on the sea chart.</i>

300
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,667 
<i>A ship has appeared right in front of us!</i>

301
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,003 
<i>That's the Going Merry!</i>

302
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,546 
<i>Hey, could this place be…</i>

303
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,923 
<i>Is this the legendary island?</i>

304
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,924 
<i>On the next episode of</i> ONE PIECE!

305
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,886 
<i>"A Solitary Island in the Distant Sea!</i>
<i>The Legendary Lost Island."</i>

306
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,346 
<i>I'm going to be King of the Pirates!</i>
